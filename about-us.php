    <p>The on-farm healthcare and management service in the Indian livestock industry is still at a 
        nascent stage. Field veterinarians are facing enormous difficulties in handling and resolving 
        cases within the hospital hours. Health, management, and productivity problems in livestock farms 
        need immediate attention and must be addressed within short turnaround time. The availability of 
        experienced veterinarian’s advisory at the local level during the wee hours is a serious challenge 
        throughout the country.
    </p>
    <p>Hence, over the years, an intense need for creating a virtual platform for the livestock healthcare 
        industry was felt, and to address this ever-increasing challenge, the promoters decided to start a 
        specialty online advisory service. Branded as “Dr. AgriVet”, the online platform caters to the Livestock
         Healthcare, Animal Husbandry Management, and Productivity Maintenance at a grassroots level. This 
         mobile application cautiously amalgamates the remedial advice specific to every species and each 
         concern raised by the farmer.
    </p>
    <p>Dr. AgriVet, the Livestock Health Care Advisory Online Platform is the first of its kind in India. 
        It enables the grassroots level of farmers to connect with the experienced veterinarians to receive 
        effective and scientific technical assistance for the entire Livestock community covering Poultry, 
        Dairy, Aqua, Companion Animals, Sheep/Goat, Pigs, and many more species to add to the list.
    </p>
    <p>Headquartered in Kolkata, DR. AGRIVET ADVISORY LLP is the developer, owner, and operator of this service. 
        The services of Dr. AgriVet do not have a geographical barrier for its users. Any livestock farmer or 
        owner of a companion animal is entitled to use this application. The user can remotely operate the 
        application from the safe environment of his respective farm/residence as there is no need for the 
        expert to be physically present on the farm. Presently, Dr. Agrivet is available in English, Hindi, 
        and Bengali languages. With the increase in the demand, Dr. Agrivet will keep expanding its regional 
        scope and will make the application available in other languages.
    </p>
    <p>Operating on a robust technology platform that ensures continued service with minimum downtime, Dr. 
        Agrivet has some of the leading veterinarians on board to provide the best of remedial treatment. 
        The platform is committed to providing the highest quality of user experience, not only by securing 
        the user data, but also safeguarding the health of your livestock and companion animal.

        unique proposition to the marginal livestock farmers of India. Noteworthy, the usage of this application
